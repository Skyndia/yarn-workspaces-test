# What I have done

- Create the packages directory and the package.json
- Go to /packages and run *ng new client*
- Run *yarn install*

# My problem

The client application can not get the link to the hoisted @angular/ packages.
I can see that going to /packages/client and running *ng --version*.
I tried to add @angular/cli dependency to the root package.json but it did not help.
